This repository serves to store an initial effort at making
a portfolio website for myself. It is a place to organize
new concepts.  However, as will be put into github soon,
index.php was taken over by indexNew.php.

Accordingly, this website is in a very rough draft form.
It is not completely populated in the repo; it just exists
on my shared hosting.  Thus a reverse deployment will occur.

NOTE: the files in this repo do not come very close to specifying
the full set intended for this rough draft web site. Git add
and commit is ongoing!
